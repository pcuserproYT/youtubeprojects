Here I will put most of my (created or just used) projects for YouTube. 
Every project is explained (and used) on a video in my channel.
Some of those are great tools, some of those are just code that can break some functionality (intentionally or unintentionally) of Windows OS. I am not responsible for any damages and the tools were created for educational purposes, to experiments and show Windows features, capabilities, bugs, etc.
This is just like the database for projects used in video downloads.

NOT ALL PROJECTS ARE CREATED BY ME! Some are just modified by me, some were created and tweaked using Artificial Inteligence tools. There could be code taken off open source platforms or parts of closed source releases. I never state that this whole project database is completely my creation, as I have explained below.
